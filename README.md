# Jenkins Shared Library (in Scripted Pipelines) - Examples

I created this repository because it took me a while to figure
out how to do even the most trivial stuff with Shared Libraries.

I hate wasting time twice, so I'm documenting it.

I'm also not a selfish person, so here you go ðŸ’–

## Examples

The files in the `vars` folder will make more or less use of the
files in the `src` folder.

You shouldn't include this shared library in your Jenkins installation,
and use the demos as is.

You should fork this repository and after you've carefully studying that I'm
not mining bitcoin on your Jenkins, you can use the demos and tailor them to your needs.

.. You probably shouldn't have a `scripted-pipelines`-folder in your Shared Library ðŸ™ƒ

### scripted-pipelines folder

A folder with examples of scripted pipelines that makes use of the library

## Contributions

Probably not.
